# AB3-Testing-Suite
A small set of commands to test AB3


## Standard Procedure

* Download the latest JAR file from the team's releases page
* Put the JAR file in an empty folder in which the app is allowed to create files (i.e., do not use a write-protected folder)
* Open a command window. Run the java -version command to ensure you are using Java 11
* Check the UG to see if there are extra things you need to do before launching the JAR file, e.g., download another file from somewhere
* Launch the jar file using the java -jar command rather than double-clicking
